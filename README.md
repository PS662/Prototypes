# Prototypes

## Overview
The **Prototypes** repository is a collection of self-contained experiments and quick concept explorations. Each folder within this repository represents an individual prototype, focusing on a specific idea or technology without being constrained by a rigid structure. This repository serves as a sandbox for trying out new concepts in a scoped and efficient manner.

## Structure
- Each folder contains a single prototype.
- Prototypes are isolated from each other to maintain simplicity and focus.
- There is no overarching structure; the goal is to keep things minimalistic and flexible.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ps662/Prototypes.git
   cd Prototypes/<prototype-folder>
   ```
